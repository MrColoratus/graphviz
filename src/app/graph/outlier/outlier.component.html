<h1>Outlier detection</h1>

<p>
    This visualization is designed to help identify statistical outliers.
    A visualization for each of the 5 criteria has been created. Each line represents an area, and the x-axis describes the area's value for a given criteria.
    The black line indicates the threshold for a given criteria. Note that for the first 4 criteria the value must be <i>above</i> the line, in order for the criteria to be fulfilled, and for the 5'th criterion (income) the value must be <i>below</i> the black line, for the criterion to be fulfilled.
</p>

<p>
    Each area has been color coded, so that ghettos have been marked by a <span style="color:red">red</span> color, and non-ghettos have been marked by a <span style="color:rgb(130, 150, 216)">blue</span> color.
</p>

<p>
    By mousing over an area, it will show you the name of the area alongside the exact value.
    By clicking on a line, the area will stay selected until another area is selected, or you click anywhere else on the website.
</p>

<p>
    Please note that the x-axis has been scaled differently for each criteria, based on the highest and lowest value in each.
